              Blitz World is a game about a rolling ball traveling the world!
              The goal is to beat all 10 worlds, ranging from the sunny plains
              to the ravaging volcanoes.

              The gameplay is based purely on physics, the ball moves by
              rotating like a real ball. This also means that you can not change
              direction mid-air, which makes for some interesting gameplay where
              you have to perform your moves carefully. This, however, does not
              remove from the fun at all, it is really fun to go fast and beat
              levels.

              It is currently in development as my first Godot project, although
              i only work on it 2 days a week when i have free time at school.

              The artstyle is based on pixelart made in Pixelorama, with a focus
              on vibrancy and contrast.
